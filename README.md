# Handwritten-Text-Recognition-
# Abstract
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) has gained significant attention due to its applications in digitizing historical documents, aiding visually impaired individuals, and enhancing information retrieval from images. This project presents a comprehensive solution for Handwritten Text Recognition, utilizing machine learning techniques and the OpenCV library The system offers the capability to upload images containing handwritten text to web-based interface. Upon upload, the system employs a combination of image preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to accurately recognize and transcribe the handwritten text.

# Features
* Image Text Extraction: Extract text from images, enabling the conversion of printed text into editable digital format with high accuracy.
* Handwritten Text Recognition: Recognize and transcribe handwritten text using machine learning models trained on vast datasets.
* OCR Integration: Seamless integration with popular OCR engines and libraries for enhanced recognition capabilities.
